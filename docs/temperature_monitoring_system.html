    <p>While operating my partnership (Pinnath LLC), I worked with one of our customers to design and develop a burn room visualizer for emergency service training. The product I developed made it possible to visualize multiple rooms in a burn scenario from a top down view as if you were looking at a thermal imaging camera. The system also provided playback and data logging for further anyalisys. </p>

<p>The tools I used for this project were primarly in the Javascript family.</p>
<ul>
<li>TypeScript</li>
<li>Vue.js</li>
<li>Koa (ES6 Express)</li>
<li>Raspberry Pi platform (as an embedded device)</li>
</ul>
<p>I also wrote firmware to communicate with the LT... device via SPI utilizing TypeScript (it can be done).</p>
